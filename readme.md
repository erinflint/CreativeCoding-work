# Week 8 Responses
This week was quite fun. I appreciated the creative freedom we were allowed and as a result decided to make my sketch look like something out of Marcus Pfister's children's book, the Rainbow Fish. I think that my final piece does accomplish this semblance in an abstract yet interactive way.
This week I used a lot of the mouseX/mouseY function because I think the movement added a necessary element to my animation
I also used the random fill function to play with colors in my "fish scales" area of my piece.
