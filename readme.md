# Week 6 Responses
This week was A LOT of trial and error for me. I really enjoyed the aesthetics of the circle examples throughout the lesson so I chose to use those in my final sketch.
In order to complete my sketch I followed along with the lesson videos/examples and played around with the various codes.
I am happy with how my sketch turned out but would like to revisit the sqrt() function later. I understand it for the most part but I know I could definitely grasp it more completely.
