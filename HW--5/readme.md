# Empty p5 sketch.

# Week 5 Homework Responses
This week we worked more on animation in p5. This week was quite fun and challenging for me. I had an initial idea for my sketch in my head but my final product (which I am quite proud of) is not exactly what I had in mind as a final version of my sketch. I had originally wanted to create a "sun setting over the pyramids of Giza" kind of visual but in the end came up with something far more visually interesting (in my opinion). My final sketch was a great exercise in learning how each individual line of code effects the others and also how nice it is to be able to utilize the myVar and mouseX/mouseY functions.
# Problems
I didn't take part in the issues forum this week because the issues raised in said forum were not any that I ran into personally/not any that I felt I had the capacity to help others solve. I did read the issues in the forum, however, and used the problems others ran into to help my own creative process.
